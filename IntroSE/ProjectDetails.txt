There was only one project for this class, a group based workflow management project. I served as a team member, focusing on UI development.

Main lessons:
- Learn the basics of full stack development
- Learn agile software development and the methodology of Scrum
- Learn to code in a group setting
- Learn to organize object-oriented code in 3 tier layered architecture
- Learn to use common IT tools such as GitHub, Visio, Trello, and Visual Studio
- Learn to draw UML diagrams
- Learn how to use .NET and C# to build a web application

Goal:
Create a workflow management system for a business of our choice that starts from gathering of materials, to manufaturing, to quality assessment, to delivery.
The system must be designed to manage incoming and outgoing products from multiple departments and generating reports.

Project details:
Complement all necessary functionality in two week sprints, where each day of class there is a team standup meeting and the last day of the sprint there are team presentations showcasing functioning code and next steps.
Each functionality step had a given input, output, normal flow, and alternate flow.
The necessary functionality is as follows:
    - Registration that provides a unique login ID for all users, dependent on the type of user; we were to consider use case diagrams for each user type and corresponding functionality
    - Stock management where there is an ID for each item in a database to manage inflow and outflow of stock
    - Product management where there is an ID for each product manufactured in a database
    - Quality assessment to test the quality of the manufactured products
    - Delivery for sending product
    - Report generation for product status
