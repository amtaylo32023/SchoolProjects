There was only one semester long project for this class which consisted of working with a local company to meet a technical requirement they had for us.
I served as both the Scrum Master and a developer for this project, due to only being a team of five.

Main lessons:
- Learn to communicate with someone in a different discipline to translate non-technical desires and requests to technical tasks
- Learn how to use Unity to create a video game
- Learn to collaborate as a team and work through team discourse.

Goal:
Use Unity to build a mobile app for a local company meeting their requirements.

Project details:
Build a story that includes relatable NPCs suitable for young adult individuals with autism.
Build game visuals to assist players with learning facial expressions and social cues to lead players to choosing most appropriate dialogue response.
