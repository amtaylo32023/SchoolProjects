Projects included:
- Intro RStudio
      The main goal of this project was to learn the basics of R and RStudio.
      To do this, I worked in a group to solve three parts utilizing concepts of:
        Rmarkdown, vectors, functions, zscores, histograms, ggplot, and linear regression.
- Visualization and Interpretation of Data
      The main goal of this project was to utilize common ML techniques in RStudio and interpret the results on clean data.
      Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, and Naive Bayes were compared.
