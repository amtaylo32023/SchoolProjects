Main lessons:
- Learn how to use RStudio
- Learn the basics of R
- Learn how to utilize RMarkdown files

Goal:
The main goal of this project was to learn the basics of R and RStudio.
To do this, I worked in a group to solve three parts utilizing concepts of:
  RMarkdown, vectors, functions, zscores, histograms, ggplot, and linear regression.

Project Details:
This project was to be completed in a group. It served as a challenge to many, because it was the first time most had seen R or RStudio.
I had used RStudio previously, but not quite in the same way that this project wanted us to use it.
My portion of the project consisted of utilizing vectors and functions to compute the temperature conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
Second, use a random number generator to create both a uniform random distribution and a random normal distribution of numbers, convert them to z-scores, and display both as histograms.
The next part of the project consisted of using ggplot to create presentable visuals with histogram, density plot, bar graph, stacked bar graph, box and whisker plot, and scatter plot.
Lastly, a linear regression model was created for a given dataset and various aspects were analyzed (added variable plots, residuals v. fitted, normal Q-Q, RSE, etc.).
For the second and third parts of the project, I assisted where needed and helped proofread the HTML file prior to final submission.
