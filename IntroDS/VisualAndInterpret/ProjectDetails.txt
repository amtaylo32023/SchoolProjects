Main lessons:
- Understand common machine learning (ML) algorithms
- Apply those ML algorithms in RStudio
- Compare algorithms on one dataset
- Understand basic interpretation techniques for both clean data and model

Goal:
The main goal of this project was to utilize common ML techniques in RStudio and interpret the results on clean data.
Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Naive Bayes were compared.

Project Details:
This project was to be completed in a group.
Key visualizations were made on the dataset prior to building the model in an effort to better understand the data and common themes/behaviors in it.
These visualizations included summary, density plots of variables, and creating factors and normalizing the numeric variables where needed to better see the data.
We performed a 60/40 test/train split on the data to build the models.
Logistic Regression, LDA, and Naive Bayes algorithms were run on the data, with the model predicitons being projected on the test data, and confusion matrices calculated for each.
An ROC curve was created for each model as well.
The AUC value and confusion matrices were used in the final analysis to compare each model.
