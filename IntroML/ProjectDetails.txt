There was only one project for this class, a semester long project that applied and compared various machine learning algorithms on one dataset.

Main lessons:
- Learn basic ML principles (categories of algorithms, characteristics of data, basic data visualizations, algorithm optimization, data splitting, etc.)
- Learn various ML algorithms including K-NN, Naive Bayes, C5.0, RIPPER, linear regression, neural network, support vector machine, apriori market basket analysis, and k-means clustering
- Learn R and RStudio

Goals:
Use R to implement ML algorithms on a chosen dataset and compare the performance of each, along with algorithm optimization methods performed.

Project details:
Follow given examples and apply to chosen dataset in RStudio.
Interpret results and rerun algorithm towards optimization.
Write a report telling of final results and comparing the performance of each algorithm on the chosen dataset.
