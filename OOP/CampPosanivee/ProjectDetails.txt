Main lessons:
- Learn how to build and manipulate binary trees in Java
- Learn when to use trees, linked lists, or queues

Goal:
Use Java to write a program that simulates common commands at a summer camp that a receptionist might encounter.
To do this, a text file read in and parsed, a camper object is created, and a binary tree is created and parsed. 
The tree is printed, new nodes inserted, nodes deleted, and searched via preorder, inorder, or postorder.

Project details:
Complete the project in phases, similar to the other project.
First creating the necessary files: main, interfaces for collection and linked lists, classes for queue and binary tree functionality, and a camper object.
Second, filling in the interfaces and basics of the object, class, and main files.
Third, filling in the object file and main to test the object the object functionality.
Fourth, filling in the class files and main to test the functionality of the class files.
Fifth, finalizing the main file to complete all of the necessary functionality.
