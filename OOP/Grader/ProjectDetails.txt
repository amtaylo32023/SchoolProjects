Main lessons:
- Learn how to implement functions in Java
- Learn how to read in text files

Goal:
Use Java to read in a text file of numerical scores and compute the average, maximum, minimum, and median of the scores.
Additionally, convert the numerical scores into letter grades by utilizing a function.

Project details:
This project was completed in parts, where the first part focused on reading in the text file correctly and pulling the information needed correctly.
The second part focused on computing the basic statistics of the numerical scores.
The third and last part was focused on implmenting the function to convert the numerical scores to letter grades.
