Projects included:
- Number Guessing Game (Project 1)
      The main goal of this project to learn the basics of Java.
      To do this I was tasked to create a number guessing game that used if/else if/else blocks and a random number generator.
- Grader (Project 2)
      Use Java to read in a text file of numerical scores and compute the average, maximum, minimum, and median of the scores.
      Additionally, convert the numerical scores into letter grades by utilizing a function.
- Date Conversion (Project 3)
      Use Java to write a program that that gave the day of the week of a date.
      To do this, functions, interfaces, and objects were utilized, along with research of calendar characteristics (Gregorian, Julian, leap years, etc.)
- Hunt the Wumpus (Project 4)
      Use Java to write a program imitating the computer game 'Hunt the Wumpus' by implementing multiple functions and objects.
- La Food Restaurant (Project 5)
      Use Java to write a program to simulate a restaurant queueing tables.
      To do this, a text file is read in and parsed, a party object is created, enqueued, or dequeued, and the average wait time of all parties is calculated.
- Sorting (Project 6)
      Use Java to write a program that compares bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, quick sort, and merge sort.
      Additionally, there was a challenge to create a new sorting method that was the fastest, which I was able to complete by modifying the merge sort algorithm.
      The results were to be printed to a Microsoft Excel table which then displayed a graph comparing the list size to the run time of each sorting algorithm.
- Camp Posanivee (Project 7)
      Use Java to write a program that simulates common commands at a summer camp that a receptionist might encounter.
      To do this, a text file read in and parsed, a camper object is created, and a binary tree is created and parsed. 
      The tree is printed, new nodes inserted, nodes deleted, and searched via preorder, inorder, or postorder.
