Main lessons:
- Learn about queues
- Learn how to implement many object-oriented principles together into one program

Goal:
Use Java to write a program to simulate a restaurant queueing tables.
To do this, a text file is read in and parsed, a party object is created, enqueued, or dequeued, and the average wait time of all parties is calculated.

Project details:
Create all of the files needed including the main, a queue interface, a queue donut object, a collection interface, and a party object.
Fill in the interface files and build the basics of the object files and main for testing purposes.
Build the rest of the functionality and functions into the objects and test thoroughly in the main.
Finalize and clean the code and complete testing to fix anything that needs fixing.
