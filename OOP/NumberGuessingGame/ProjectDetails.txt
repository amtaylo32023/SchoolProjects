Main lessons:
- Learn the basics of Java
- Learn how to begin mastering a new coding language
- Learn how to simulate random numbers

Goal:
The main goal of this project to learn the basics of Java.
To do this I was tasked to create a number guessing game that used if/else if/else blocks and a random number generator.

Project details:
This was a simple project meant to ease into a new language and apply basic programming principles in an effort to focus on learning syntax.
Beacuse of this, this project utilized simple coding expressions and commands to create a fun number guessing game.
