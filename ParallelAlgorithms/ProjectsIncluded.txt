Projects included:
- Intro MPI (Project 1)
      The main goal of this project was to understand how to use MPI in C++.
      To compete this, there were 3 mini projects involved in the completion of this project.
- Sequential mergesort algorithm (Project 2)
      Use C++ to write a program that implements a recursive function mergesort algorithm.
- Parallel mergesort algorthim (Project 3)
      Use C++ to write a program that implements a 'parallel' version of the mergesort algorithm.
- Sequential 2-3 trees (Project 4)
      Use C++ to write a program to implement a sequential 2-3 tree.
