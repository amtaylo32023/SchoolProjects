Main lessons:
- Remember the inner workings of the mergesort algorithm
- Write the mergesort algorithm sequentially to prepare for next project where it's done in parallel

Goal:
Use C++ to write a program that implements a recursive function mergesort algorithm.

Project details:
Use given function definitions to write entire program.
One function recursively split the array into smaller pieces, while the other merged the pieces back together in the correct order to make a final sorted array.
