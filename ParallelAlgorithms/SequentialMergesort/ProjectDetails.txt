Main lessons:
- Remember the inner workings of the mergesort algorithm
- Write the mergesort algorithm sequentially to prepare for next project where it's done parallely

Goals:
Use C++ to write a program that implements a recursive function mergesort algorithm.

Project details:
Use given function calls to write entire program.
One function call:
  void mergesort (int * a, int first, int last);
where a is a dynamically defined array based on user-input size.
This function is recursive and must take less than 10 lines of code.
Second function call:
  void merge (int * a, int * b, int lasta, int lastb, int * output = NULL);
where a and b are pointers and references to specific positions in the overall array.
The lasta and lastb variables indicate their last positions and output is the intermediate sorted array.
Array a serves as the unsorted array at the beginning and also the final sorted array.
